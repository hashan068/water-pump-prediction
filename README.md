# Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table

## Challenge Summary

Can you predict which water pumps are faulty to promote access to clean, potable water across Tanzania? This is an intermediate-level practice competition. Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, your task is to predict which pumps are functional, which need repairs, and which are non-functional. By predicting one of these three classes based on various variables, you can help improve maintenance operations and ensure clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.
